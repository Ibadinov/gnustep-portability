This header set is intended to be used while porting Mac apps to GNUstep.
Currently it consists of two headers you may be interested in:
    TargetConditionals.h
    AvailabilityMacros.h
In future it will include following:
    OSTypes.h
    OSAtomic.h

1.1 Install
===========

Currently there is no automatic installer, just copy files under the 'Headers' folder to the location of your choise.

1.2 Usage
=========

Add 'Portability' folder to your compilers include path. Build.
Warning: please do not reference them as <Portability/SomeHeader.h> - it will invariably lead to #ifdefs in code.

1.3 License
===========

LGPLv2

Happy hacking!
